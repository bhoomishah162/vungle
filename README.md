# vungle
Vungle's A/B testing experiment seeks to determine if the new ad-serving algorithm (Algorithm B) generates higher eRPM, improves Click-Through Rates (CTR), increases conversion rates from impressions to installs, and impacts the fill rate to ensure optimal ad inventory utilization compared to the existing algorithm (Algorithm A).
